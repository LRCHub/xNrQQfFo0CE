I wrote a protest song about you, about you
Set off on a long march without you, without you x2
I wrote a protest song about you, about you
About whats left that lies between us, I'm walking
So many things we're burning for
I set myself on fire without you, without you
I wrote a song about you, about you
That not a soul was meant to hear, except you
I wrote a protest song about you, about you
I cheated gravity to chase you, to chase you
And through the burning space between us, you're falling
You have a long way, long way to fall
I set myself on fire without you
I wrote a song about you, about you
That not a soul was meant to hear, except you
So many things we're burning for (Repeat 7X)
