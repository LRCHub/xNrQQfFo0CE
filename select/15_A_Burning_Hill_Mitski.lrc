[00:12.55] Today, I will wear my white button-down
[00:19.56] I'm tired of wanting more
[00:23.46] I think I'm finally worn
[00:27.05] For you have a way of promising things
[00:33.67] And I've been a forest fire
[00:37.32] I am a forest fire
[00:40.99] And I am the fire and I am the forest
[00:44.63] And I am a witness watching it
[00:48.85] I stand in a valley watching it
[00:52.24] And you are not there at all
[01:06.24] 
[01:04.08] So today, I will wear my white button-down
[01:14.04] I can at least be neat
[01:17.32] Walk out and be seen as clean
[01:20.84] And I'll go to work, and I'll go to sleep
[01:24.60] And I'll love the littler things
[01:28.48] I'll love some littler things
