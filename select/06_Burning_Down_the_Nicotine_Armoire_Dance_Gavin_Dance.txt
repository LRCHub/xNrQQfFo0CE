and they would follow you home)
(until we wind up dead)
(checking your pulse)
(we'd wait across the street)
(under our tree)
(outside the front door)
(in autumns blind embrace)
(but you wouldn't let her anyway and we run)
(and we framed these moments)
(till one remaining cold calculated thought)
today your dream is dead
and when you wake it won't be there
today your dream is dead
and sew that smile up with threads
embrace this hope
and let it flow
you failed it
to shy to know your worth
hurt from insensitive behavior
you're scared of what this really is
and where this might lead us next
don't let me go I feel it
(it grabbed us by the throat)
(it grabbed us by the throat and we continue to breathe)
it's how I feel about love
that it's not worth it
(your license) i
n failure dreams fall
pushing nightmares over pavement
walking these streets like a victim
writing death threats in the wet cement
you say I will lie
and let me win this life
you won't regret my love
make you happy at your best
you'd noticed all of this meaningless
I destroy you
even through
the only things that I have left for your
condescending eyes looking at each others
white lies my heart ache is useless
so quickly we'll address the shadows running
from light
It'll take this breathe
denying what is left of us
if you could just wake up tonight
I'd be with you under the sky with you tonight
