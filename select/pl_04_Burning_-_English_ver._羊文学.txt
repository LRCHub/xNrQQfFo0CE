Always been trapped into my life
No matter how I try,
I cannot get it right
Back in my mind again
and now it feels like
Nobody sees me like I do
Trying to find a way
to get a hold on
To everything that’s dear to me
but then I don’t know
Why I leave every time
But I’m crying
And the moment the show is on,
I realize
All of my heart wants to be
As a voice in the world
let me scream
Can you hear me now
from where you are?
Trying to be someone I can’t be
Trying to find the ways
to get outside of me
And here I am,
I can’t seem to go on
How do I find my way
out of here?
And every time
I cook up a reason
To try to get away
from the dreams I thought I had
Keeps coming back into my life
All smiles to haunt me
to make me see
I’ve wanted this, all this time
But I’m crying
In the light of the stage I see,
I realize
Whatever comes my way
Be it pain, be it rain,
let me be
Everything I’ve always wanted
Lying
In the moment behind a veil
I hide away
All of my words unsaid
They are scars in their own way
The voices in my mind
try to tell me
Know better than
to believe in miracles
I won’t ever have my way
How many more chances
will come by
Claiming it will satisfy me
How can I be
Somebody I want to be?
Crying
In this moment
before the metamorphosis
I’ll make my scars lead the way
From the darkness
a rupture of light
Here’s to everything I wanted
Lying
In the light of the stage I see,
I realize
Whatever comes my way
Be it pain, be it rain,
let me be
Everything I’ve always wanted
And all this time
It never leaves my mind
